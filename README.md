### Machine Learning Project on Telecom Churn Prediction

Repo Consists of Files for Telecom Churn Prediction. We have made the prediction using the various machine learning models through which we evaluated the model based on the evaluation metric, and found which learning model is best suited.

Churn - Basically it refers when customer is likely to leave the services which are provided by the service provider.

To start with the prediction, we firstly proceed with the phase by phase, starting from:
 - Data Preprocessing for cleaning the data and data encoding (converting raw data to binary data).
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), for finding the patterns trough which customers are likely to churn.
 - Feature Selection, used for identifying the attributes which are contributes to prediction, whether the customer is going to churn or not.
 - Model Developing, using the machine learning models to predict the churn, we implemented three models for predicting, which are Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XG-Boost, and based on that selecting which model is best suited for the model.
 - Evaluation, based on the performance metrics, and based on the metrics to evaluate the model.
 - Validation, involvs the testing the model on a dataset from the training, through which it measures the model performance and its capability to generalize on unseen data.
 - Comparision the performanc of different models.

# Project Overview
• We explored the Telecommunication Churn Prediction, where we started by analyzing the dataset, then performing Feature Engineering, and lastly comparison of three learning models to see which is the best fit for the dataset in terms of accuracy.

• Models used were Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XG-Boost out of three models XG-Boost outperformed others with Accuracy of 85.2 percentage, F1 Score of 85.3 percentage, and precision of 85.4 percentage and recall of 85.2 percentage. ROC curve illustrated that the XG-Boost has the highest AUC value of 0.92, which has a strong ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn customers.

• Error Analysis revealed that all the models showcased the similar patterns of errors, which suggests that the model may benefit from tuning or extra features o improve the accuracy for the customer segments.

•  Further we implemented the Model Comparison through differenct Model Evaluation Metrics to evaluate the model which is best suited.

• To Conclude, we can state that the XG-Boost Model showed better performance, which helped for churn prediction in telecommunication industry, and further it can be optimized to provide the valuable insights for Customer Retention Strategies.


# Dataset

As the Dataset is too big and cannot be uploaded as it exceeds the maximum length of the file. So, I have uploaded the files to Google Drive also.
